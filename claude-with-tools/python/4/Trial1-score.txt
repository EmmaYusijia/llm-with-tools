Note: didn't mention data serialization at all.

Most of the use of tools stayed the same as before. Tools are very helpful in the general workflow:
searching for relevant files and reading in files. However, based on the rubrics, I think tools are not able to
help fill in what's missing. There could be other functions tools can provide to help, but at least not the current
tools: bash and read. I'm not sure how edit works at this point because it was first used in 3 and failed.
