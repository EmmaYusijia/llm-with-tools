"Based on my analysis, here's my assessment of whether UTF-8 should be used instead of ASCII for decoding the host:
## Analysis
The current code in `requests/cookies.py:64` uses ASCII decoding when converting a bytes Host header to string. 
This is technically correct according to HTTP standards, but it has limitations.

### Current Behavior
- The code decodes byte-string Host headers using ASCII: `host = host.decode('ascii')`
- This was added to handle cases where the Host header is provided as bytes (commit 01e405c6)

### HTTP Standards Perspective\nAccording to RFC 7230 (HTTP/1.1):
- HTTP header field values should be limited to visible ASCII characters
- However, the Host header specifically should contain either:  
    - ASCII-only hostnames  
    - Internationalized domain names (IDN) in Punycode format (xn-- prefix)

### The UTF-8 Question
While UTF-8 might seem more flexible, using it for Host headers could actually cause problems:
1. **Standards Compliance**: 
Host headers should not contain raw UTF-8 encoded international characters. 
They should be IDNA/Punycode encoded first.

2. **Current Implementation**: 
The requests library already handles internationalized domains correctly in `models.py:366` by encoding them to IDNA before use.

3. **Compatibility**: 
Using UTF-8 decoding could mask incorrect usage where raw UTF-8 bytes are passed instead of properly encoded hostnames.

### Recommendation\n**Keep ASCII decoding** for the following reasons:
1. It's correct per HTTP standards
2. It will properly fail if someone incorrectly passes UTF-8 encoded international characters
3. The proper flow for international domains is:
- User provides Unicode domain: `café.example.com`
- Requests converts to Punycode: `xn--caf-dma.example.com`
- This ASCII-compatible encoding works with current decode

If you need to handle international domain names, ensure they're properly IDNA-encoded before being passed as the Host header, rather than changing the decoding to UTF-8."
