Perfect! I found the `get_full_url` method in the `MockRequest` class in `/Users/emmayu/crqbench/projects/requests/requests/cookies.py:52`.
Looking at the code, it's handling a case where the Host header might be a bytes object that needs to be decoded to a string for URL reconstruction. 
The question asks whether UTF-8 should be used instead of ASCII for decoding.

<answer>
No, ASCII is the correct encoding to use here. Host headers in HTTP must contain only ASCII characters according to HTTP specifications (RFC 7230). 
International domain names must be encoded using Punycode (which produces ASCII-compatible encoding) before being used in HTTP headers. 
Using UTF-8 instead of ASCII could mask protocol violations where non-ASCII characters are incorrectly present in the Host header, potentially leading to security issues or unexpected behavior.
