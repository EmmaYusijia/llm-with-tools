Looking at this code from the requests library's cookies module, I can see it's part of the `MockRequest` class's `get_full_url()` method, 
which handles reconstruction of URLs when a custom Host header is provided.

No, ASCII should be used as the default encoding, not UTF-8. According to HTTP standards (RFC 7230), the Host header must contain only ASCII characters. 
Hostnames must be either IP addresses or domain names conforming to DNS syntax (ASCII letters, digits, and hyphens). 
International Domain Names (IDNs) must be encoded using Punycode, which is ASCII-compatible. 
Using ASCII encoding enforces proper HTTP compliance and will raise an exception if invalid non-ASCII characters are incorrectly included in the Host header, which is the appropriate behavior.
