Based on my analysis of the code and the recent commits, here's my assessment of whether UTF-8 should be used instead of ASCII as the default encoding when decoding the host:

## Current Situation
The code currently uses ASCII decoding for the Host header in `requests/cookies.py:64`:
\n```python\nhost = host.decode('ascii')\n```

## Analysis
1. **HTTP Standards**: 
According to RFC 7230 (HTTP/1.1), HTTP headers should be encoded using ASCII. The Host header specifically should contain either:
- A registered domain name (ASCII characters)
- An IP address
- An internationalized domain name (IDN) encoded using Punycode/IDNA (which results in ASCII)

2. **Current Implementation Logic**: 
The code only decodes when there's a type mismatch - when the parsed URL scheme is a string but the Host header is bytes. 
This is a compatibility fix to avoid mixing bytes and strings.

3. **IDNA Handling**: 
The codebase already handles internationalized domain names properly in `requests/models.py:366`:\n   ```python\n   host = host.encode('idna').decode('utf-8')\n   ```   
This suggests that IDNs are expected to be handled at a different layer.

## Recommendation\n\n**
No, UTF-8 should NOT be used instead of ASCII** for the following reasons:
1. **Standards Compliance**: HTTP headers are defined to be ASCII. Using UTF-8 would be non-standard.

2. **IDN Support**: Internationalized domain names should be IDNA-encoded (Punycode) before being used in HTTP headers, which results in ASCII-compatible strings.

3. **Security**: Using UTF-8 could introduce security vulnerabilities through homograph attacks or encoding confusion.

4. **Compatibility**: The current ASCII decoding maintains compatibility with HTTP specifications and existing infrastructure.

If a user needs to use non-ASCII domain names, they should:
- Use IDNA encoding (Punycode) for the domain name
- Or let the higher-level APIs handle the conversion automatically
The current implementation is correct and follows HTTP standards. The ASCII decoding is appropriate for the Host header context.
