1a -1 (only mentioned UTF-8 might seem more flexible)
Final score: 3/4

Most of the use of tools stayed the same as before except the following:
1. Bash was used to check git history for ASCII decode in cookies.py,
and details of the commit about Host header bytestring.
2. Edit was first used, with the purpose of creating a test to explore the behavior with non-ASCII hosts:
"input":{"replace_all":true,"file_path":"/Users/emmayu/crqbench/projects/requests/test_utf8_host.py","old_string":"placeholder","new_string":"#!/usr/bin/env python\n# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
Test UTF-8 vs ASCII decoding for Host header
However, it later ran into an issue: "File does not exist".
{"type":"user","message":{"role":"user","content":[{"type":"tool_result","content":"<tool_use_error>File does not exist.</tool_use_error>","is_error":true,"tool_use_id":"toolu_01JKfZXRwwcRTeRdLdPNDtRg"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"b174d3b6-f88c-45c0-aca7-c55f4a317379","uuid":"754efaa1-ddbc-492c-9174-0e210f0fc808","tool_use_result":"Error: File does not exist."}
Because of that, Bash was used to create test file for UTF-8 vs ASCII host decoding (maybe as alternative choice because bash is usually used for searching)
And it ran into an issue again: "require approval for safety".
Error: This command uses shell operators that require approval for safety
After that, it turned to the HTTP RFC standards for host header encoding for help.
