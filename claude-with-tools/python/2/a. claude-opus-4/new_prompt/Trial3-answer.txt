Looking at this code, I can see this is a performance metrics aggregation system that tracks response times, latencies, and connection times. 
The `_compact_times()` method is being called at the start of `recalculate()`.

To answer your question about whether to call `_compact_times()` on every KPIset or only cumulative ones:
<answer>
You should call `_compact_times()` only on cumulative KPIsets. Regular/short-lived KPIsets likely don't accumulate enough data to warrant the overhead of compaction. 
Cumulative KPIsets that continuously aggregate data over time need periodic compaction to prevent unbounded memory growth and maintain calculation performance. 
Consider adding a check like `if self.is_cumulative or len(self[self.RESP_TIMES]) > threshold:` before calling `_compact_times()`.
</answer>

The reasoning is:
1. **Memory efficiency**: Cumulative KPIsets accumulate data indefinitely and need compaction to prevent memory exhaustion

2. **Performance**: Compacting small datasets adds unnecessary overhead

3. **Data characteristics**: Short-term KPIsets typically have bounded data that doesn't require compaction

You might want to make this decision based on:
- The size of the response times list
- Whether the KPIset is marked as cumulative
- How long the KPIset has been collecting data
- A configurable threshold for when compaction becomes beneficial
