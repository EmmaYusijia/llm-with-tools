Based on my analysis of the code, I can see that `_compact_times()` is a method that compacts the response time distribution when it exceeds a maximum length (1000 entries by default). 
It merges nearby response time values to prevent memory issues.

Looking at the implementation and usage patterns:
1. **What `_compact_times()` does**: 
It reduces the number of response time entries by merging adjacent values when the distribution exceeds `rt_dist_maxlen` (1000).

2. **When it's needed**: 
Both individual KPIsets (collecting samples directly) and cumulative KPIsets (merged from others) can accumulate many response time entries over time.

3. **Safety**: 
The method checks if compaction is needed (`redundant_cnt > 0`) and only performs work when necessary, making it safe to call on any KPISet.

You should call `_compact_times()` on every KPIset, both individual and cumulative. The method is designed to be safe and efficient 
- it only performs compaction when the response time distribution exceeds the maximum length threshold. 
Since both types of KPIsets can accumulate many response time entries (individual ones from samples, cumulative ones from merging), 
and the method includes a guard condition to only compact when needed, it's appropriate to call it unconditionally in the `recalculate()` method as currently implemented.
