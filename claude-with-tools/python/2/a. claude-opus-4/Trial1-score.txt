2c -1
Final score: 6/7

Note: In this trial, the model's conclusion is that:
You should call `compact_times()` on both current and cumulative KPISets**, 
but it's already being handled automatically through the `recalculate()` method.

Bash was very helpful and worked well in finding files including terms mentioned in the question.
Then Read was used here to read in files that Bash found.
Bash also searched for certain function or related method usage patterns in the files.
