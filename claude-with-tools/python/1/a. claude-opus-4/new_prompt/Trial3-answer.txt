Looking at the code, I can see this is a bug. Let me analyze the difference:
1. **`F.cross_entropy`** - This is the correct PyTorch function from `torch.nn.functional` (imported as `F` on line 15). 
This is the proper way to calculate cross-entropy loss in PyTorch.

2. **`cross_entropy`** - This is a bug on line 120. There's no standalone `cross_entropy` function defined or imported anywhere in the code. 
This would cause a `NameError` when the code runs.

The issue becomes clearer when you look at the surrounding code:
- Line 120 calls `cross_entropy(logits[val_idx], labels[val_idx])` but doesn't assign the result to anything
- Line 123 tries to print `val_loss.item()`, but `val_loss` is never defined
- Line 123 also references `train_acc` which is never calculated

The correct code should be:
```python\nval_loss = F.cross_entropy(logits[val_idx], labels[val_idx])\n```
This appears to be an incomplete refactoring or copy-paste error where someone forgot to:
1. Add the `F.` prefix
2. Assign the result to `val_loss`
3. Calculate `train_acc`

<answer>
The difference is that `F.cross_entropy` is the correct PyTorch function from `torch.nn.functional`, 
while `cross_entropy` (without the F. prefix) is a bug in this code - it's an undefined function that would cause a NameError at runtime. 
The line should be `val_loss = F.cross_entropy(logits[val_idx], labels[val_idx])` to properly calculate and store the validation loss.
