Looking at the actual code, I can now see the issue clearly. 
In the code, there are two different ways cross_entropy is being called:
1. **`F.cross_entropy`** (lines 110 and 128) - This is the correct PyTorch functional API method from `torch.nn.functional` (imported as `F` on line 15)
2. **`cross_entropy`** (line 120) - This is a bug in the code. There is no standalone `cross_entropy` function imported or defined anywhere.

The problematic line 120:```python\ncross_entropy(logits[val_idx], labels[val_idx])\n```
This line will cause a `NameError` when executed because `cross_entropy` is not defined. 
Looking at the context, it appears this line should calculate the validation loss and assign it to `val_loss`, since line 123 tries to use `val_loss.item()`. 
The correct line should be:```python\nval_loss = F.cross_entropy(logits[val_idx], labels[val_idx])\n```
Additionally, the code also references `train_acc` on line 123 which is never calculated, indicating there are multiple bugs in this training loop.

The difference is that `F.cross_entropy` is the correct PyTorch functional method from `torch.nn.functional`, 
while the standalone `cross_entropy` call is a bug - it's an undefined function that will cause a NameError. 
The line should be `val_loss = F.cross_entropy(logits[val_idx], labels[val_idx])` to properly calculate and store the validation loss.
