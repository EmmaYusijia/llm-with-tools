Based on my analysis of the DGL codebase, I can explain the difference between `F.cross_entropy` and `cross_entropy`:

## The Difference
1. **`F.cross_entropy`** 
- This is the correct PyTorch function from `torch.nn.functional` module. 
It's imported with: ```python\n   import torch.nn.functional as F\n   ```   
Then used as `F.cross_entropy(predictions, targets)`

2. **`cross_entropy`** (without prefix) 
- This appears to be a bug in the code at `/Users/emmayu/crqbench/projects/dgl/examples/pytorch/rgcn/entity_classify.py:120`. 
The code is trying to call `cross_entropy` without the `F.` prefix, but this function is not imported or defined anywhere in the file.

## The Bug
Looking at the code pattern:
Line 110: `loss = F.cross_entropy(logits[train_idx], labels[train_idx])` ✓ Correct
Line 120: `cross_entropy(logits[val_idx], labels[val_idx])` ✗ Bug - missing `F.` prefix
Line 128: `test_loss = F.cross_entropy(logits[test_idx], labels[test_idx])` ✓ Correct
The line 120 appears to be calculating validation loss but:
1. It's missing the `F.` prefix
2. The result isn't assigned to any variable (likely should be `val_loss`)

## Summary
In PyTorch/DGL context:
- **Always use `F.cross_entropy`** when you've imported `torch.nn.functional as F`
- Plain `cross_entropy` without a prefix will result in a `NameError` unless you've specifically imported it differently

The correct usage is always with the module prefix: `F.cross_entropy(predictions, targets)`
