Based on my analysis of the DGL codebase, I can explain the difference between `F.cross_entropy` and `cross_entropy`:
In the context of PyTorch (which is commonly used with DGL):

1. **`F.cross_entropy`** 
- This is the standard PyTorch function from `torch.nn.functional` module. It's imported as:
python import torch.nn.functional as F Then used as `F.cross_entropy()`. 
This is the correct and standard way to calculate cross-entropy loss in PyTorch.

2. **`cross_entropy`** (without the `F.` prefix) 
- In the file `/Users/emmayu/crqbench/projects/dgl/examples/pytorch/rgcn/entity_classify.py:120`, 
there's actually a bug where `cross_entropy` is called without the `F.` prefix. 
This appears to be a typo or error in the code.

The key differences:
- `F.cross_entropy` is the proper PyTorch functional API for computing cross-entropy loss
- `cross_entropy` alone would cause a `NameError` unless it's been imported or defined separately
- In the RGCN example at line 120, it looks like someone forgot to add the `F.` prefix

This is confirmed by looking at the pattern in the file:
- Line 110: `loss = F.cross_entropy(...)` ✓ Correct
- Line 120: `cross_entropy(...)` ✗ Missing F. prefix (bug)
- Line 128: `test_loss = F.cross_entropy(...)` ✓ Correct

So in summary, you should always use `F.cross_entropy` when working with PyTorch's functional API. 
The bare `cross_entropy` in this codebase appears to be an error.
