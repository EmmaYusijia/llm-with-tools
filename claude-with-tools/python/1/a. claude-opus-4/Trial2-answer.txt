Based on my analysis of the codebase, I can explain the difference between `F.cross_entropy` and `cross_entropy`:

## The Difference
1. **`F.cross_entropy`** 
- This is the correct usage. It refers to `torch.nn.functional.cross_entropy`, where `F` is typically imported as:
python import torch.nn.functional as F
This is the standard PyTorch functional API for computing cross-entropy loss.

2. **`cross_entropy`** 
- This appears to be a bug in the code! 
Looking at `/Users/emmayu/crqbench/projects/dgl/examples/pytorch/rgcn/entity_classify.py:120`, 
there's a line that calls: python cross_entropy(logits[val_idx], labels[val_idx])
This is problematic because:
- There's no import for a standalone `cross_entropy` function
- The result isn't assigned to any variable
- On line 123, the code tries to use `val_loss.item()` but `val_loss` was never defined
- This will cause a runtime error when the code executes

## The Bug
The line should actually be:
python\nval_loss = F.cross_entropy(logits[val_idx], labels[val_idx])

This is clearly a typo where someone forgot to:
1. Add the `F.` prefix
2. Assign the result to `val_loss`
Throughout the DGL codebase, the correct pattern is consistently `F.cross_entropy` for PyTorch examples and `mx.nd.softmax_cross_entropy` for MXNet examples. 
There is no standalone `cross_entropy` function that should be used directly.
