Based on my analysis of the code, I can now provide a comprehensive answer about the difference between using `HashMap` and `singletonMap` in this context.
<answer>
In this code, `new HashMap<>(Collections.singletonMap(...))` creates a mutable HashMap copy from an immutable singleton map, 
while using just `Collections.singletonMap(...)` would pass an immutable single-entry map. 
The practical difference is that the HashMap copy is mutable (can be modified later by adding/removing entries), whereas singletonMap returns an immutable map that throws UnsupportedOperationException on modification attempts. 
Since the messageParams method accepts a HashMap<String, Message> parameter specifically, creating a mutable HashMap wrapper ensures type compatibility and allows potential future modifications to the map if needed by the UidFetchCommand implementation.
