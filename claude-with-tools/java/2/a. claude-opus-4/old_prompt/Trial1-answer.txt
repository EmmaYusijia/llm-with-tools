Now I understand the context. Let me explain the difference between using HashMap and singletonMap as a parameter to messageParams:
## Difference between HashMap and singletonMap for messageParams
Looking at the code, the `messageParams` method expects a `HashMap<String, Message>` parameter. 
In the test file at `/Users/emmayu/crqbench/projects/thunderbird-android/k9mail-library/src/test/java/com/fsck/k9/mail/store/imap/selectedstate/command/UidFetchCommandTest.java:110-111`, we see:
```java\n.messageParams(fetchProfile, new HashMap<>(Collections.singletonMap(String.valueOf(uid),\n        (Message) createImapMessage(String.valueOf(uid)))))\n```
Here's the key difference:
1. **Collections.singletonMap**
- Returns an **immutable** map with exactly one key-value pair
- Cannot be modified after creation (no put, remove, etc.)
- Memory efficient for single entries
- Type: `Map<K, V>` (not specifically HashMap)

2. **HashMap**
- A **mutable** map implementation
- Can be modified after creation
- Less memory efficient for single entries
- Type: `HashMap<K, V>`

### Why wrap singletonMap in HashMap?
The code wraps `Collections.singletonMap` with `new HashMap<>()` because:
1. **Type requirement**: The `messageParams` method specifically expects a `HashMap<String, Message>`, not just any `Map`

2. **Mutability**: If the code later needs to modify the map (though it doesn't appear to in this case), it needs a mutable HashMap

3. **API consistency**: 
The method signature enforces HashMap for consistency across the codebase

### Alternative approaches:
If you only need a single entry and don't need mutability, you could:
- Change the method signature to accept `Map<String, Message>` instead of `HashMap<String, Message>`
- Use a HashMap directly: `new HashMap<String, Message>() {{ put(key, value); }}`
- Create a utility method to create single-entry HashMaps

In this specific case, the wrapping seems unnecessary since the map is only used for reading in the fetch operation, but it's required due to the strict type signature of the `messageParams` method.
