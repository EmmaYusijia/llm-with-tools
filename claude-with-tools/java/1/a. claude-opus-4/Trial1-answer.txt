Yes, the code at the end of `initializeFromLocalSearch` does depend on `drawer`. 
Looking at the method:
1. **Line 1701-1702**: First checks if `drawer == null` and returns early if it is null
2. **Lines 1703-1709**: If drawer is not null, it uses the drawer to:
- `drawer.selectFolder(folderServerIds.get(0))` when in single folder mode (line 1704)
- `drawer.selectUnifiedInbox()` when the search is for unified inbox (line 1706)  
- `drawer.selectFolder(null)` in other cases (line 1708)
The last actual line of code in the method (line 1712) sets the visibility of `actionBarSubTitle`, which doesn't depend on the drawer.
This code appears to be related to the fix mentioned in the recent commit \"7f8894c8f9 Don't try to operate on an uninitialized drawer\", where they added the null check to prevent operations on an uninitialized drawer.
