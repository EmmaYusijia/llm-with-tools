Yes, the code at the end of `initializeFromLocalSearch` does depend on the `drawer` variable. 
Looking at lines 1701-1709:
```java\nif (drawer == null) {\n    return;\n} else if (singleFolderMode) {\n    drawer.selectFolder(folderServerIds.get(0));\n} else if (search.getId().equals(SearchAccount.UNIFIED_INBOX)) {\n    drawer.selectUnifiedInbox();\n} else {\n    drawer.selectFolder(null);\n}\n```
The code explicitly checks if `drawer` is null on line 1701. 
If it is null, the method returns early and skips the drawer-related operations. 
If `drawer` is not null, it performs various operations on the drawer based on the search mode:
1. In single folder mode, it selects a specific folder
2. In unified inbox mode, it selects the unified inbox
3. Otherwise, it clears the folder selection
This is related to the git commit message \"Don't try to operate on an uninitialized drawer\" (commit 7f8894c8f9), which suggests there was a bug where the drawer might not have been initialized when this code was executed.
