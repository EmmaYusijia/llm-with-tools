Looking at the code segment, I can see that there's a conditional check for `drawer`:
```java\nif (drawer == null) {\n    return;\n}\n```
This check occurs before the code attempts to use the `drawer` object in the subsequent else-if/else blocks:
- `drawer.selectFolder(folderServerIds.get(0));`
- `drawer.selectUnifiedInbox();`\n- `drawer.selectFolder(null);`
The early return when `drawer == null` prevents any `NullPointerException` that would occur if the code tried to call methods on a null `drawer` object.

However, there's one line at the very end of the method that executes regardless of whether `drawer` is null:
```java\nactionBarSubTitle.setVisibility((!singleFolderMode) ? View.GONE : View.VISIBLE);\n```
This line manipulates `actionBarSubTitle` and doesn't depend on `drawer` at all.
<answer>\nYes, most of the code at the end of initializeFromLocalSearch depends on drawer being non-null. 
The method includes a null check that returns early if drawer is null, preventing the drawer-dependent operations from executing. 
However, the very last line that sets the actionBarSubTitle visibility executes regardless of drawer's state and is not dependent on it.\n</answer>"
