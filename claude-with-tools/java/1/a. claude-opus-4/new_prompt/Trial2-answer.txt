Looking at the code segment, I can see that the code at the end of `initializeFromLocalSearch` definitely depends on `drawer`.

Let me analyze the flow:
1. The method first initializes search parameters and determines if it's in single account/folder mode

2. Then there's an explicit null check: `if (drawer == null)`

3. If `drawer` is null, the method returns early with `return;`

4. If `drawer` is not null, it continues to execute conditional logic that calls various methods on `drawer`:
- `drawer.selectFolder(folderServerIds.get(0))`
- `drawer.selectUnifiedInbox()`
- `drawer.selectFolder(null)`

5. After the drawer operations, there's one final line that sets the visibility of `actionBarSubTitle`, which executes regardless of the drawer state (but only if drawer wasn't null, since otherwise the method would have returned).

Yes, the code at the end of `initializeFromLocalSearch` depends on `drawer`. 
The method performs an explicit null check on `drawer` and returns early if it's null, preventing any of the subsequent drawer operations from executing. 
The drawer object is used to select different folder views based on the search configuration, making it a critical dependency for the method's completion.
