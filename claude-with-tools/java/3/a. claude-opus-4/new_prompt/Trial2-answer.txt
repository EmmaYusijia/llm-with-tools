Now let me examine how `mPrefix` is initialized in the constructors to understand if it can be null:

Looking at the class, I can see that:
1. `mPrefix` is declared as `private final String mPrefix` (line 49)

2. In all constructors, `mPrefix` is directly assigned from the constructor parameter without any null checks

3. The `equals()` method (line 258) actually includes a null check for `mPrefix`: `mPrefix != null ? !mPrefix.equals(that.mPrefix) : that.mPrefix != null`

4. The `hashCode()` method (line 266) also handles null: `mPrefix != null ? mPrefix.hashCode() : 0`

This indicates that the developers anticipated that `mPrefix` could potentially be null.

Yes, you should add a null check for `mPrefix`. While the current code only checks for empty strings, 
the `equals()` and `hashCode()` methods already handle the possibility of `mPrefix` being null, which suggests it's a valid state. 
Without a null check, calling `mPrefix.length()` would throw a NullPointerException if `mPrefix` is null. 
The check should be: `if(mPrefix != null && mPrefix.length() > 0)`.
