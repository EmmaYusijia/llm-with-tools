Now let me examine the class structure to understand how `mPrefix` is initialized and used:

Looking at the code, I can see that:
1. `mPrefix` is declared as a `final String` field (line 49)
2. It's initialized in the constructors (lines 72, 89-91, 96-97, and 103)
3. The class already performs null checks in the `equals()` method (line 258)
4. The class already performs null checks in the `hashCode()` method (line 266)

Let me check if there's any possibility of `mPrefix` being null by examining the constructors more carefully:
1. In the main constructor (lines 59-85), `mPrefix` is directly assigned from the parameter without any null check

2. In the constructor at line 100, there's an assertion that checks if the path starts with prefix, which would fail if prefix is null

3. The other constructors delegate to the main constructor

Yes, you should add a null check for `mPrefix`. While `mPrefix` is a final field that gets initialized in the constructor, 
there's no validation preventing null values from being passed to the constructor. 
The current code would throw a `NullPointerException` if `mPrefix` is null when calling `mPrefix.length()`. 
Adding a null check before the length check would make the code more robust and prevent potential runtime exceptions. 
The check should be: `if (mPrefix != null && mPrefix.length() > 0)`.
